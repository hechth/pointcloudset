This code is developed in the strategic project Sensor FDIR.
Do not share with anyone outside of vif!
You are free to use it as a like in other projects as long as the code is not shared.

If the code is used for a publication please contact: thomas.goelles@v2c2.at to discuss co-authorship.

The goal is to make the code open source after we get some initial publications out of it.
